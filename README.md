Generate Mazes - in Excel!

Simple Maze Generator in Excel


ReadMe

This excel file allows you to gain an intuitive understanding of how simple maze generation algorithms work in the basic setting of an excel workbook.
The approach underpinning this model is largely based on that used in the book "Mazes for Programmers" by Jamis Buck. It is an excellent book that teaches you how to generate and solve mazes in a fun and engaging way.

This model only implements the first two maze generation algorithms presented in the book, allowing the user to adjust the direciton of those maze types.
I hope this model motivates you to try out different and creative maze generation approaches!


Instructions:
This model does not have any macros - everything is formulae-based.
To generate a new maze, simple press "F9" on the keyboard.
In addition, you can change:
 - the maze type via the drop-down list on the "Visuals" tab (cell DR2)
 - the probability of horizontal corridors via cell DU67
 - the location for the Flood-Fill solving algorithm in the highlighted cells in row 272
